1.0.0-beta4 (13.1.2016)

**BC BREAKS**

`#697`: As part of the implementation of `yii\base\Object` for ActiveWindows the process how the ActiveWindow and the ngrest works together slightly changed. Use `$config->aw->load()` instead of `$config->aw->register()`, as the ActiveWindow will be loaded directly on call. Examples of how to load the active window:

```php
load('app\modules\foobar\test\MyActiveWindow');
load([
    'class' => 'app\modules\foobar\test\MyActiveWindow',
    'property1' => 'value for property 1'
]);
```

`#690`: The new `admin\base\GenericSearchInterface` interface defines a new method `genericSearchStateProvider()` which defines the condition for the angular uirouter state to enable item clicks.
