 * LUYA Crawler
 *
 * The Crawler will create an index with all pages based on your defined `baseUrl`. You can run the crawler by using the command
 *
 * ```sh
 * ./vendor/bin/luya crawler/crawl
 * ```
 *
 * This will create an index where you can search inside (See helper methods in `luya\crawler\models\Index` to find by query methods).
 * You should run your crawler command by a cronjob to make sure your page will be crawled everynight and the users have a fresh index.
