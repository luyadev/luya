Thats it, the new admin UI is available!

It took us almost a half year to make a new admin ui and integrate it. We have rewritten all css and html files. There was also plenty of work for the Angular Scripts.

< SCREENSHOT >

Initialy we have planed to release version 1.0.0 at this time, but the new admin interface brings so much changes that we are depending on all the LUYA developers to report bugs and missing features, therefore this is RC4.

What else have we done?

+ You can now arrange placeholders within the grid system in the admin, which means you can apply your frontend design to the admin with rows and cols.
+ Composer Plugin can now load blocks and bootstrap files from composer.json
+ Dashboard objects within modules, easy generate a dashboard object from your admin module (like display latest news, last logins, etc.)
+ Import and Export helper classes.
+ Admin has now developer toolbar which tracks you all the requests.
+ Added new scafolding commands and extended the exists ones, creating filters, activewindows and cruds is now even more intelligent.
+ Added postgreSQL Support
+ Added new ngrest plugins like CheckboxRelationActiveQuery, Sortables and a beautiful Color Wheel.
+ Administration file uploading as now more secure.
