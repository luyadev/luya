# Developer guidelines

Here are some simple rules how to deal with documentations, linking or using PHPDoc.

## Documentation & guide

Informations about creating guides and how they are displayed on luya.io:

+ Heading 1 titles will be removed from rendering on luya.io and the navigation title is used instead
+ Heading 2 titles will be used to automatically generate the table of contents on luya.io

In order to create a link inside the guide or PHPDoc to a PHP Class use the following syntax:

+ `{{luya\base\Module}}` This will generate a link to the API for the given class name.
+ `{{luya\base\Module::$apis}}` Generate a link to an API class with property `$apis`.
+ `{{luya\base\Module::resolveRoute()}}` Generate a link to an API class with the method `resolveRoute()`.

If you want to link from the API PHPDoc to the guide use:

+ `[[concept-tags.md]]` Assuming the markdown file would be located in the `/docs/guide` folder.

When dealing with a Controller, Action or another PHP names use single quotes \`MyController\`. For example `MyController` would name the controller defined in the file `MyController.php` with the action `indexAction()`, same notation goes for PHP variables like `$foobar`.

### Wording

This represents a guideline how words and proper nouns should be written in the documentation.

+ LUYA - always capitalized
+ Composer 
+ AngularJS
+ NgRest
+ ActiveWindow
+ ActiveRecord
+ admin UI - instead of Admin, admin module or Admin UI
+ GitHub
+ API
+ OSX
+ PHP
+ HTML
+ DRY
+ CRUD
+ e.g. - instead of f.e., for example or similar expressions
+ yourdomain.com - instead of example.com, yourproject.com, etc

It should be avoided to use personal pronouns (e.g. we have this, we recommend that, you can, etc.), please use impersonal pronouns ( e.g. there is this, itÂ´s recommend that, etc.).

## Coding conventions

The following conventions have to be used when contributing to the LUYA project.

### PHP 

[PSR2 Naming convention](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). This example encompasses some of the rules below as a quick overview:

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooInterface;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

class Foo extends Bar implements FooInterface
{
    public function sampleFunction($a, $b = null)
    {
        if ($a === $b) {
            bar();
        } elseif ($a > $b) {
            $foo->bar($arg1);
        } else {
            BazClass::bar($arg2, $arg3);
        }
    }

    final public static function bar()
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

The example above shows how to intend brackets.

### PHPDOC

All classes have to use a standard PHPDoc block including the *author* and *since* tag.

```php
/**
 * Title for the class with Dot.
 *
 * The description of the class with a dot at the end.
 *
 * @property string $virtualProperty This describes the response of the vritualProperty
 * @property \luya\base\Module $virtualProperty This describes the response but ensures class linkable IDE abilities.
 *
 * @see Take a look at luya\base\Module::resolveRoute()
 * @deprecated Deprecated in 1.0.10 will be removed in 2.0.0 use luya\base\Module instead.
 * @author John Doe <john@example.com>
 * @since 1.0.0 
 */
class FooBar()
{
}
```

> If there are `@property` tags available for the class, they should be separated from the tags below.
 
In order to refer to inherited methods use:

```php
/**
 * @inheritdoc
 */
public function init()
{

}
```

Example for using since tags in a new method of a class:

```php
class FooBar
{
    /**
     * Register new Article.
     *
     * An article, such as a news article or piece of investigative report.
     * Newspapers and magazines have articles of many different types and this is intended to cover them all.
     *
     * @param array $config Optional config array to provided article data via setter methods.
     * @return \luya\web\jsonld\Article
     * @since 1.0.1
     */
     public static function article(array $config = [])
     {
         return self::addGraph((new Article($config)));
     }
}
```

### SQL

SQL Database table and field namings:

+ Tables are singular
+ Table and column names are seperated by underscore (_)
+ The primary key is always ***id***
+ ***All*** tables have to use the module name as prefix. (e.g. admin_*)
+ Always use the frontend-module name as a prefix if there are both modules available (frontend and backend).

Table name examples:

+ admin_user
+ admin_user_setting
+ admin_group
+ admin_user_group (Reference table between user and group)
+ admin_user_group_ref (Alternatively the reference table could contain the suffix `_ref` or `_rel`)
+ news_data
+ news_category

Field name examples (for table *admin_user*):

+ id
+ firstname
+ password_salt
+ group_id


### SCSSS

The SCSS folder contains all SCSS files and is structured as follows:

| Folders | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `base/` | Contains basic styles like the reboot, angular fixes and default styles for tags |
| `browser-fixes/` | Contains specific browser fixes, for each fix we use a different file (e.g. _ie.scss) |
| `components/` | Here all the components are stored. See "components" further down |
| `fonts/` | Contains font-face and mixins for the specific font. |
| `helpers/` | Mixins and functions |
| `variables/` | All variables used in this project |

**Components/**

All classes for a component are prefixed with the components name. If you have to select something by HTML tag, be sure that there is no way to select it by a specific class (if you can add a class to the element, go for it).
Children of a component are seperated with a `-`.

Example:

Component: `_crud.scss`

Classes in component: `.crud`, `.crud-header`, `.crud-title`, `.crud-table`

HTML:

```html
<div class="crud">
 <div class="crud-header">
  <h1 class="crud-title">Title</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="crud-table">
  <table class="table">...</table>
 </div>
</div>
```

> You can see that all classes for the `crud` component are prefixed with `crud-`. That way we always know what we can find in which SCSS file. In the HTML you can see that there is a standalone component `table`, wrapped by the class `crud-table`. This results in an extra scss component `_table.scss`.
