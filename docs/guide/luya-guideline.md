# Developer Guidelines

Below some rules how to deal with documentations, linking or using the php docs.

## Documentation & Guide

Informations about creating guides and how they are rendered on luya.io:

+ Heading 1 titles will automatically removed from the rendering on luya.io, therefore the navigation title will be used instead. So you add a heading markdown notation on a file, but you don't have to.
+ Heading 2 titles will be used in order to auto generate a table of contents on luya.io.

In order to make a Link somewhere inside the Guide or PHPDoc to a PHP Class use:

+ `{{luya\base\Module}}` This will generate a link to the API for this class.
+ `{{luya\base\Module::resolveRoute()}}` Genrate a link to the luya\base\Module and method `resolveRoute()`.
+ `{{luya\base\Module::$apis}}` Genrate a link to the luya\base\Module and property `$apis`.

In order to make links from the API PHPdocs to the Guide use:

+ `[[concept-tags.md]]` where the markdown file is a file located in `/docs/guide` folder.

When dealing with Controller, Action and other PHP names use single quotes \`MyController\`. Like `MyController` is the file `MyController.php` with the action `indexAction()`, this is also for Variables `$foobar`.

### Wording

This represents a guideline how words and proper nouns should been written in the documentation.

+ LUYA - always capitalized
+ Composer 
+ AngularJS
+ NgRest
+ Admin UI
+ API
+ OSX
+ PHP
+ e.g. - instead of f.e., for example or similar

+ Controller
+ Action
+ Module
+ Model

Further it should be avoided to use personal pronouns (e.g. we have this, we recommed that, etc.), please use unpersonal pronouns ( e.g. there is this, itÂ´s recommend that, etc.).


## PHPDOC

All classes must have a php doc block which is sorted as follow including author and since tag.

```php
/**
 * Title for the class with Dot.
 *
 * The description of the class should be available like this also with a dot at the end.
 *
 * @property string $virtualProperty This describes the response of the vritualProperty
 * @property \luya\base\Module $virtualProperty2 This describes the response but ensures class linkable IDE abilities.
 *
 * @author John Doe <john@example.com>
 * @since 1.0.0 
 */
class FooBar()
{
}
```

> When `@property` are available they are separated to the other tags below.
 
In order to refer to inherited methods use:

```php
/**
 * @inheritdoc
 */
public function init()
{

}
```

## Versioning

This project make usage of the [Yii Versioning Strategy](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/internals/versions.md).

## CODING CONVENTIONS

The following conventions are used when contributing to the LUYA project.

### PHP 

PSR2 Naming convention

(http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)

This example encompasses some of the rules below as a quick overview:

```php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooInterface;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

class Foo extends Bar implements FooInterface
{
    public function sampleFunction($a, $b = null)
    {
        if ($a === $b) {
            bar();
        } elseif ($a > $b) {
            $foo->bar($arg1);
        } else {
            BazClass::bar($arg2, $arg3);
        }
    }

    final public static function bar()
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

### SQL

SQL Datbase Table and Field namings:

+ Tables are singular
+ Table and column names are seperated by underscore (_)
+ The Primary Key is always ***id***
+ ***ALL*** tables have the module name as prefix. (e.g. admin_*)
+ Always use the FRONTEND-MODULE name as prefix if there are both.

table name examples

+ admin_user
+ admin_user_setting
+ admin_group
+ admin_user_group (Reference table between user and group)
+ admin_user_group_ref (Alternative the reference table can contain the suffix `_ref` or `_rel`)
+ news_data
+ news_category

field name examples

+ table: admin_user
+ id
+ firstname
+ password_salt
+ group_id

### JS

### JSON-SCHEMA:

## Admin Module CSS Informations

The css and html files for the admin module are based on the following rules.

### Admin Design compile

To compile css and js to one file we use [our Gulp Workflow](https://github.com/zephir/zephir-gulp-workflow).  
To install gulp and the dependencies on your System [follow the guide](https://github.com/zephir/zephir-gulp-workflow#dependencies).

Everything will be compiled to the folder `dist/` in the corresponding `{module}/resources` folder.

> **Important:** The JS files and their order are all defined in the `compileConfig.js`. If you add a new JS file, make sure to add it in the config as well.

**Module: admin**  
Run `gulp` in the following directory: `modules/admin/src/resources`.

**Module: cmsadmin**  
Run `gulp` in the following directory: `modules/cms/src/admin/resources`.
