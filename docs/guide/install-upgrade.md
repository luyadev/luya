# Upgrading LUYA

This page describes how to update an existing LUYA instance to the latest version.

## Composer

Change the LUYA versions for each modules and LUYA itself in your composer.json

```json
"require": {
    "luyadev/luya-core" : "^1.0",
    "luyadev/luya-module-cms" : "^1.0",
    "luyadev/luya-module-admin" : "^1.2"
}
```

After updating the file, execute the update command of Composer which could take a few minutes.

```sh
composer update
```

Now you got a new Composer lock file, which can be used for other team members to install the new LUYA version.

## Console

After updating with Composer, run the following command to upgrade the database:

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya migrate
```

Now refresh all existing importer components with the LUYA import commmand:

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya import
```

Sometimes image filters changes and you should reprocess all images in the filemanager:

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya admin/storage/process-thumbnails
```

## Upgrade the application code

Read the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/luyadev/luya/blob/master/core/CHANGELOG.md) to see all new, fixed and breaking features. The **most important** when upgrading into another version is to [read the BC Breaks Guide](https://github.com/luyadev/luya/blob/master/core/UPGRADE.md) in order to see all changes which have to be done in your application to run the newest version of LUYA.
