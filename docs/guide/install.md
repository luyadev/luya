# Create a LUYA Application

The LUYA installation requires Composer. Please have a look at the [official Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) if you havenÂ´t installed it on your system yet.

> Find the [installation Video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybq878PMe_U) in order to help you install LUYA.

## Composer create-project

After setting up Composer, we execute the Composer command `create-project` to checkout the **luya-kickstarter** application, an **out of the box** LUYA setup to run your website directly. It is recommended to run the `create-project` command directly from your htdocs/webserver folder like this:

```sh
composer create-project luyadev/luya-kickstarter:^1.0
```

> Info: For more LUYA Kickstarter packages, check the [kickstarter packages section](https://luya.io/packages).

> Note: During the installation you may be asked for the GitHub login credentials. This is normal, because Composer needs to get enough API rate-limit to retrieve the dependent package information from GitHub. For more details, please refer to the [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#api-rate-limit-and-oauth-tokens).

> Note: In previous versions the fxp Composer plugin was required `composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.4"` but this has been replaced with [Asset Packagist](https://asset-packagist.org). If the Asset Packagist is not present in the `composer.json`, you might install the fxp plugin as it is a "legacy" project setup.

The `create-project` command will create a folder (inside of your current folder, where the `composer create-project` command was executed) named **luya-kickstarter**. 

## Copy Config

If the Composer installation is done, switch to **configs** folder inside the application and copy the `.dist` template files to original `.php` files.

```sh
cp env.php.dist env.php
```

Now the database connection inside the `configs/config.php` file needs to fit your MySQL servers' configuration. It is recommended to open all config files once to change values and understand the behavior. In order to understand the config files, read more in the [environment configs section](install-environments.md).

## Run Migrate and Import

After successfully setting up your database connection, you have to reopen your terminal and switch to your project directory and excute the **luya** binary files, which has been installed into your vendor folder by Composer as described below.

Run the migration files with the [migrate console command](luya-console.md):

> Note: If the migration process failed, try to replace localhost with 127.0.0.1 in the database DNS configuration `(env-local-db.php)` which is located in the  configs folder.

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya migrate
```

Build and import all filesystem configurations into the database with the [import console command](luya-console.md):

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya import
```

## Run admin/setup

Finally execute the [setup console command](luya-console.md) command, which is going to setup a user, group and permissions:

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya admin/setup
```

The setup process will ask you for an email and password to store your personal login data inside the database (of course the password will be encrypted).

> `./vendor/bin/luya health` will make a small check if several directories exist and readable/writable.

You can now log into the administration interface, e.g. `http://localhost/luya-kickstarter/public_html/admin` (dependings on the location of the LUYA files).

> Check the [Installation Problems and Questions Site](install-problems.md) if you have any problems with the LUYA setup.

## Docker (docker-compose)

When you run the LUYA Kickstarter with docker-compose (see the docker-compose.yml for more details) you start the Docker container by using

```
docker-compose up
```

Afterwards all dependencies will be installed and a webserver including a database is running. You can now run a specially Docker setup command:

```
docker-compose exec luya_web setup
``` 

This will run the migrate, import and setup command with a default user `admin@admin.com` and password `admin`. To run further commands use

```
docker-compose exec luya_web luya <console_command>
```
