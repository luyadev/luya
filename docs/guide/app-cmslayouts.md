# CMS Layout

If you are using the CMS Module in your application (which is installed by default in the kickstarter application) then you can use the CMS Layouts.

All CMS Layouts are stored in the `views/cmslayouts` folder which is located in the base path of your project. If we create a new layout with 2 columns (for example) we just add a new view template to the cmslayouts folder:

```
views/cmslayouts/2columns.php
```

You can now add html content to the new cmslayout file *2columns.php* but the most important is to let the cms know on which part of the file the user can add content (blocks). To mark the area which can be filled with user content defined the area with `<?= $placeholders['YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME']; ?>`. In the example below we have made 2 placeholders for each column (left and right):

```php
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <?= $placeholders['left']; ?>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <?= $placeholders['right']; ?>
    </div>
</div>
```

You have now created a new cms layout which will be available after the import process.

> Info: Files starting with *.* or *_* will be ignored. Cmslayouts in subfolders will also be ignored.

## Import and Use

To enable the new cmslayout file, or after updating an existing layout file, you have to run the `import` command from the Terminal.

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya import
```

The import process will notify you what have been changed or added to your database:

```
luya\cms\admin\importers\CmslayoutImporter:
 - new 2columns.php main.php found and added to database.
```

In order to change the labels of the placeholder go to `CMS Settings -> Layouts` in the administration area.
