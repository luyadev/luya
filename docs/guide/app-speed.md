# Page Speed

There are a few things you can do to speed up your application when runing in production environments.

## Caching

You should always enable caching in production! Caching stores data inside the runtime folder which will reduce the number of sql requests. LUYA admin and cms are using the caching system where often for large and time consuming tasks.

In order to enable the caching open your config and add the caching to the components section:

```php
'components' => [

    // ...
    
    'cache' => [
        'class' => 'yii\caching\FileCache',
    ]
]
```

> When using LUYA Deployer, the runtime folder will be recreated for each deployment. You can also force recaching by click the reload button to the left bottom in the Admin UI.

There are also a few other caching mechanism available and built in into Yii, see the [supported Cache Storage](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-caching-data.html#supported-cache-storage)

## Database

In order to reduce the sql requests you can also enable schema caching in your database component, this will only work if you have defined a caching mechanism from above.

```php
'components' => [

    // ...
    
    'db' => [
        'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
        // ...
        'enableSchemaCache' => true,
    ]
]
```

When dealing with large database tables in your application you should define database indexes (for example when working with mysql).
