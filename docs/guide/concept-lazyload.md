# Image lazy loading

To reduce server load and speed up page requests, LUYA is shipped with a built in {{\luya\lazyload\LazyLoad}} widget.

You can use the Lazyload widget in 3 different ways:

## Basic usage

This just displays a grey area instead of the image while loading.

> The basic usage already provides a no-script fallback.

```php
<?= LazyLoad::widget([
        'src' =>  $this->publicHtml . '/path/to/image',
        'width' => 'the-image-width-in-px',
        'height' => 'the-image-height-in-px',
        'extraClass' => 'custom-classes'
    ]);
?>
```

## With smaller preview

Display a smaller preview of the image while loading the bigger version.

The plugin doesn't need any width or height informations in this mode, but the smaller
image should have the same dimension.

For example: The Original file has a resolution of 100x100px,
the smaller version should have 10x10, 20x20 or 30x30px.

Based on what styles you apply to your image (`custom-classes`) this might work or not.
You can try to update the placeholder-image styles by using its class and your custom class: `.custom-classes .lazyimage-placeholder-image`

> Includes a noscript fallback.
> Make sure to implement a `nojs` or `no-js` class into you `body` or `html` tag.

```
<?= LazyLoad::widget([
        'src' =>  $this->publicHtml . '/path/to/image',
        'placeholderSrc' => $this->publicHtml . '/path/to/image_very_small',
        'extraClass' => 'custom-classes'
    ]);
?>
```

> Tip: If you use LUYA Admin you can let the [LUYA Filters](app-filters.md) do the work for you.


### Base64 encode

To enable base64 encoding of your placeholder image, you have to make sure that your placeholderSrc is an absolute URL and then set `placeholderAsBase64` to `true`.

```
<?= LazyLoad::widget([
        'src' =>  $this->publicHtml . '/path/to/image',
        'placeholderSrc' => $this->publicHtml . '/path/to/image_very_small',
        'placeholderAsBase64' => true,
        'extraClass' => 'custom-classes'
    ]);
?>
```


## As background image

To use the lazyloader with a background image, e.g. on a `<div class="lazy-image"></div>`, you just have to set the `attributesOnly` parameter to `true`.

> Remember to use a noscript tag to show the image if no javascript is present.
> The plugin doesn't need any width or height information in this mode, make sure to define these
> yourself.

```php
<div <?= LazyLoad::widget([
        'attributesOnly' => true,
        'src' =>  $this->publicHtml . '/path/to/image',
        'extraClass' => 'custom-classes'
    ]); ?> >
</div>

<!-- Fallback for no-js -->
<noscript><div class="custom-classes" style="background-image: url(<?= $extras['image']->source ?>);"></div></noscript>
```

## Event

Each image wich is fully loaded will trigger an event `lazyimage-loaded` on the `document`.
The event provides an object with the image id (ID selector) and the type of the event (`success` or `error`).

```
$(document).on("lazyimage-loaded", function(e, response) {
    $(response.imageId).doStuff();
});
```

## Using lazy loader with storage component

Using the lazy loader with a storage component {{\luya\admin\image\Item}} is easier because you can automatically get the width and height from the storage component:

```php
$image = Yii::$app->storage->getImage(123);
<?= LazyLoad::widget([
    'src' => $image->source,
    'width' => $image->resolutionWidth,
    'height' => $image->resolutionHeight,
]); ?>
```
