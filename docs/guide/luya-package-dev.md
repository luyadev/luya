# Create package (Extension/Module/Theme)

This guide is intended to provide the very basic steps to create a LUYA Package (also known as extension or module). 
There are different type of packages:

|type|description
|----|----------
|extension|Is used when you have blocks, helpers, assets, widgets, components and other files but no module or controller.
|module|Can contain the same as an extension but also modules and controllers which needs to be registered in the config of the application.
|theme|A theme holds informations including blocks, layouts and CMS layouts.

## Create basic extension with a block

n this guide we will give you a very basic step by step instruction in **how to create an extension** with a block for the CMS which will be distributed over the packagist package manager.

You can use this skeleton for a new package: https://github.com/luyadev/luya-package-skeleton

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luyadev/luya-package-skeleton
cd luya-package-skeleton
```

1) Create a repository on GitHub, make sure the repository is public, otherwise we can not register on packagist.org.
2) Create a `composer.json` with basic informations about the VENDOR and PACKAGE name. Replace VENDOR with your GitHub username or vendor name, and PACKAGE with the package name. Example `nadar/luya-material-blocks`.

```json
{
    "name": "VENDOR/PACKAGE",
    "type": "luya-extension",
    "require-dev": {
        "luyadev/luya-testsuite": "^1.0"
    },
    "autoload" : {
        "psr-4" : {
            "username\\package\\" : "src/",
        }
    },
    "extra": {
      "luya" : {
        "blocks": [
            "src{{DS}}blocks"
        ]
      }
    }
}
```


3) As we have mappend the namespace `VENDOR\PACKAGE` into the `src/` folder you can now create you block inside the src folder, example `src/HeroBlock.php`.

```php
<?php
namespace PACKAGE\PACKAGE;

use luya\cms\base\PhpBlock;

class HeroBlock extends PhpBlock
{
    // code for block goes here ...
}
```

4) In order to test the blocks you can register with Composer https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path or provide the CMS admin the path to the blocks `'cmsadmin' => ['blocks' => 'path/to/blocks/src']]`.
5) Now you should commit and push the code to GitHub and register the package on packagist: https://packagist.org/packages/submit

## Composer definition informations

As LUYA is built upon the Composer package manager every extension must be included via Composer. Therefore first create your own Composer package by creating a `composer.json` file, e.g.:

```json
{
    "name": "username/package",
    "type": "luya-extension",
    "minimum-stability": "stable",
    "require": {
        "luyadev/luya-core": "^1.0"
    },
    "extra": {
    
    }
}
```

The following **types** are supported by LUYA Composer

+ luya-extension
+ luya-module
+ luya-theme

|Composer-Type|Description
|----|----------
|`luya-extension`|Is used when you have blocks, helpers, assets, widgets, components and other files but no module or controller.
|`luya-module`|Can contain the same as luya-extension but also modules and controllers.
|`luya-theme`|Can contain the same as extensions but also CMS layouts, layouts and other frontend resources.

## Extra section

The `composer.json` file can contain an extra section which can be read by the LUYA Composer. E.g. we could do the following things:

```json
"extra" : {
    "luya" : {
        "blocks": [
            "path{{DS}}to{{DS}}blocks"
        ],
        "bootstrap": [
            "namespace\\to\\the\\Class"
        ]
    }
}
```

+ blocks: Include the provided folders or blocks while import command. Use `{{DS}}` for the directory seperator, the LUYA Composer plugin auto replace by current OS specific directory seperator.
+ bootstrap: Add the file to the LUYA bootstraping process.

> When importing blocks a namespace for each block class have to be provided. You can use the [Composer autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) feature handle namespaces.

## Bootstraping dependencies in dependencies (child dependencies)

Its very common to create a "private" (company specific let' say) repository containing code for several projects and also includes the LUYA requirements like `admin` and `cms`. As LUYA strongly relys on the [LUYA Composer](https://github.com/luyadev/luya-composer) which contains a `bootstrap` section to make more easy to load data when creating extensions and modules this can be a problem when work with child Dependencies (A Dependencies of a Dependencies).

Assuming the following scenario we have a `BaseRepo` and an `ProjectApplication` where the `ProjectApplication` requires the `BaseRepo` as a dependency.

**BaseRepo:**

```json
{
     "require": {
        "luyadev/luya-module-cms" : "^3.0"
     }
}
```

**ProjectApplication:**

```json
{
     "require": {
        "mycompany/base-repo": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

As the `ProjectApplication` now requires the `BaseRepo` as a dependency the [Bootstraping Section of LUYA Module CMS](https://github.com/luyadev/luya-module-cms/blob/master/composer.json#L48-L50) is ignored. Therefore its important to call those requirements again in your `BaseRepo`:

**Fixed BaseRepo:**

```json
{
     "require": {
        "luyadev/luya-module-cms" : "^3.0"
    },
    "extra" : {
        "luya" : {
            "bootstrap": [
                "luya\\cms\\frontend\\Bootstrap"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Otherwise you can either call the Bootstrap Section in your config or the LUYA CMS Bootstraping methods won't be run.
