Deployment and Sync
===

As part of the LUYA ecosystem, we have developed processes to sync and deploy your website. This guide explains the best practice of how to bring your website online and sync it back to your local development environment.

The following is required to reproduce the steps in this guide:
+ Git repository (we use GitHub)
+ Server with SSH access (Prod environment)
+ A local development machine with LAMP or WAMP Stack


**We never sync data from the local environment to the production server, only the opposite way!**

When starting to build a website, you create a Git repository for the project, check out the LUYA kickstarter project, add the included files into the new Git repository and start developing your website.

We recommend that you deploy the website to the server in an early stadium of the development cycle. So use dummy text and data on your local system.

Deployment

1. Set up your production environment on the server (create database, enable ssh, etc.)
2. Change the `env-prod.php` config.
3. Install and configure the [LUYA DEPLOYER](https://luya.io/guide/module/luyadev---luya-deployer) so you can deploy your website with the `./vendor/bin/dep luya prod` command.

You are now ready to deploy your website to the server and can start to add content on the production environment.

We have developed a sync command to synchronize the database and files from the production environment to a number of local clients. In order to set up this command, log in to the admin interface of your website on the production server, navigat to System -> Machines and create a new one. You will have to copy the identfier and token that is generated in the next step.

Now run the `./vendor/bin/luya admin/proxy` command. You will have to enter the URL of your production environment (like `https://luya.io`) and then enter the machine and identifier from the previous step.
