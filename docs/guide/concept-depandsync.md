# Deployment and Sync

As a very powerful part LUYA ecosystem a timesaving and pretty awesome processes for synchronization and deployment has been developed. This guide explains the best practice of how to bring your website online and sync it back to your local development environment.

The following is required to reproduce the steps in this guide:

+ Git repository (we use GitHub, BitBucket or others are working too).
+ Server with SSH access (Prod environment).
+ ssh keys so you can fetch the data from the production server. There is a good tutorial on setting up the keys [here](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
+ A local development machine with LAMP or WAMP stack.

This process never syncs data **from the local environment to the production server**, only the **opposite way**!

When starting to build a website, follow this proposed process:

1. create a GitHub repository for the project
2. check out the LUYA kickstarter project
3. add the included files into the new GitHub repository (don't commit the vendor directory - this is downloaden by composer)
4. start developing your website.

We recommend that you deploy the website to the server in an early stadium of the development cycle. So use dummy text and data on your local system.

## Deployment

1. Set up your production environment on the server (create the database, enable ssh, etc.)
2. Change the `env-prod.php` config.
3. Install and configure the [LUYA deployer](https://luya.io/packages/luyadev--luya-deployer)
4. Deploy your website with the `./vendor/bin/dep luya prod` command.

### Connection strategies

You can connect to the server either using:

* Pasword `->password('your pwd')`
* Identity file `->identityFile('~/.ssh/yourkey')`
* PEM file (e.g. using AWS or Lightsail) `->pemFile('~/.ssh/yourfile.pem')`

We recommend to use either the identity or pem strategie: this way you can commit your `deploy.php` file on your repo, without having to store a pasword on the repo, which you don't want to do of course.

### Example configuration file

```php
require 'vendor/luyadev/luya-deployer/luya.php';

// define your configuration here. Uncomment the connection strategy of your choice (we recommend pem)
// Change the $VAR with your information
server('prod', 'server.servername.com', 22)
        ->user('$USERNAME')
        //->identityFile('~/.ssh/identityfile')
        //->password('$PWD') 
        //->pemFile('~/.ssh/pemfile.pem')
        ->stage('prep')
        ->env('deploy_path', '/home/appname/'); // Define the base path to deploy your project to.

set('repository', 'git@github.com:$GITHUBUSER/$REPONAME.git');
```

You are now ready to deploy your website to the server and can start to add content on the production environment.

## Synchronization

![luya-proxy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luyadev/luya/master/docs/guide/img/luya-proxy.gif "LUYA Proxy Sync")

The developed `./vendor/bin/luya admin/proxy` sync command synchronize the database and files from the production environment to a number of local clients. 
In order to set up this command login to your LUYA admin UI on the production server, navigate to `System -> Machines` and create a new one. 

After creation of your local machine you have to copy the `identifier` and `token` that is generated in the next step.

Now run the `./vendor/bin/luya admin/proxy` command in your terminal. 
You will be asked to enter the URL of your production environment (e.g. `https://luya.io`) and then enter the machine and `identifier` and `token` from the previous step.

Terminal commands:

`./vendor/bin/luya admin/proxy` --> run or setup proxy urls and secret token  
`./vendor/bin/luya admin/proxy/clear` --> clear and reset local stored proxy configuration

In case an error occurs when executing the `admin/proxy` command, executing the `admin/proxy/clear` command first might help (you will have to enter the url, identifier and token after resetting the configuration with the `clear` command).

For details and more commands, see {{luya\admin\commands\ProxyController}}.

## Deploy prep env


When running a pre-production env (prep) its very common to copy the database and files after deployment but its recommend to achieved that with deployer and admin/proxy via the smart way. Therefore just update your **deploy.php** following the example below:

```php
task('deploy:syncProdEnv', function() {
    $proxy = run('cd {{release_path}} && ./vendor/bin/luya admin/proxy --url=https://www.prod-website.com --idf=IDENTIFER --token=TOKEN');
    writeln($proxy);
    
})->onlyOn('prep');
after('deploy:shared', 'deploy:syncProdEnv');
```

Now on every deployment to the prep env by using `./vendor/bin/dep luya prep` will sync the files from the prod env.
