Console commands
================

To execute a console command open your Terminal and go into the base directory of your *LUYA* project. The base diretory is where vendor, public_html, runtime, etc. folders are located, for instance when you run the [luya-kickstarter](install.md) its in `luya-kickstarter`.

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya <command>
```

> On Windows Systems you can run commands via the composer exec command: `composer exec luya <command>`

Where *command* is one of the following commands below:

Create your own command
------------------------
You can always create your custom command. Custom commands are stored within a module in the folder `commands`. The main differenc is that commands can only be execute from the console command and does not have view files to render, an example command. We assume you have moulde *yourmodule* with a contorller *NotifyController* with two actions *actionIndex* and *actionBar*:


```php
<?php

namespace yourmodule\commands;

class NotifyController extends \luya\console\Command
{
    public function actionIndex()
    {
    	return $this->outputSuccess('action successfully done');
    }

	public function actionBar()
	{
		return $this->ouputError('Something failed inside this action');
	}
}
```

> Always use `ouputError($message)` or `outputSuccess($message)` to return the status of the execution inside of the command, depneding on this output we can handle PHPUnit test easy and return colorized outputs.

To run the `actionIndex()` from the above mentioned `NotfyController` controller in the `yourmodule` module:

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya yourmodule/notify
```

to execute the `actionBar()` we have to change the route for the noify controller:

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya yourmodule/notify/bar
```
