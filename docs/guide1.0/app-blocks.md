# CMS Blocks

What are Blocks? Blocks are elements used in the CMS Module to display and configure data. Blocks are dropped into the placeholders of an [CMS Layout](app-cmslayouts.md). An easy example of a block could be a paragraph tag where the user can add the content. LUYA CMS Modules ships with some default blocks, but you can always create your own elements.

## Create a new Block

> use `./vendor/bin/luya block/create` console command to generate a block.

You can add blocks to your project application or you can also add them to a module, in any case the folder name where the blocks are stored must named as **blocks**. Additionaly blocks should have the suffix `Block`. For example we build a block `TextTransformBlock` and store it in `app/blocks` or `app/modules/yourmodule/blocks`.

> In 1.0.0-beta8 the new *PHP BLOCKS* are introduced. This allows you to use PHP Views instead of TWIG Templates. In order to use The new PHPBlocks you can extend the block from `cmsadmin\base\PhpBlock`. PhpBlocks does automatically requires a view file and the `twigAdmin()` is replaced by `admin()` method.

This is what the `TextTransformBlock` could looke like in your code:

```php
<?php
namespace app\blocks;

class TextTransformBlock extends \cmsadmin\base\PhpBlock
{
    public function icon()
    {
        return 'extension'; // https://design.google.com/icons/
    }
    
    public function name()
    {
        return 'Transformed Text';
    }
    
    public function config()
    {
        return [
            'vars' => [
                ['var' => 'mytext', 'label' => 'The Text', 'type' => 'zaa-text'],
            ],
        ];
    }

    public function extraVars()
    {
        return [
            'textTransformed' => strtoupper($this->getVarValue('mytext')),
        ];
    }

    public function admin()
    {
        return 'Administrations View: {{ vars.mytext }}';
    }
}
```

As we have switched to PHPBlock by default (in beta8) you now have to create also a view file, which is located in the view folder of your project: `app/views/blocks/`. The view file itself does have the same name is the class name of your block: `TextTransformBlock.php`. In your example from above the view file could look like this:

```php
<?php
/**
 * @var $this \luya\cms\base\PhpBlockView
 */
?>

<?php if ($this->context->getVarValue('mytext')): ?>
    <h1><?= $this->context->getExtraValue('textTransformed'); ?></h1>
<?php endif; ?>
```

#### Register and import

After creating the Block in your project you have to *Import* block into your system. The reason behind the import process is to avoid rely on database structure and to work with php files you can also check into version controller system. Run the [Import Command](luya-console.md):

```sh
./vendor/bin/luya import
```

This will add or update the block into the cms system. If you rename the block or remove a block from the filesytem, the old block will be deleted from your database.

#### Methods in detail

|Name|Return|Description
|----|--------|------------
|icon|string|Return the [Materialize-Icon](https://design.google.com/icons/) name
|name|string|Return the Humand Readable name for the administration area.
|config|array|Define all config variables there user can input in the administration area `cfgs`, `vars` and `placeholders`. Read more about [CMS Block Config and different input types](app-block-types.md).
|extraVars|array|Define additional variables to your template, so you can reuse them inside your view with `$extras.VAR_NAME`.
|admin|string|Returns the [Twig.js](https://github.com/justjohn/twig.js/wiki) template to be display in the administration area.

### Module blocks

When you add a block inside of a module you have to define the `$module` properties, this is will make sure the view files are found in the correct folder. This way you can redistributed blocks with your own package for other users.

```php
class TestBlock extends \cmsadmin\base\Block
{
    public $module = 'mymodule';
}
```

#### Override default blocks

Sometimes you just want to change the default behavior/template of systems blocks, you can always override all blocks provided from the system by adding a twig template with the name of the block in your project application views folder. Assuming you want to override the **template** of the `TextBlock` which is provided by default from the LUYA cms core. To do so go into your application view folder `views/blocks` and add a twig template with the name of the block, in this case `TextBlock.twig` now the system will pick and render this template first. In addition to this method you could also make a custom block and extend from the existing Text block. `class MyTextBlock extends \cmsadmin\blocks\TextBlock` and override the `twigFrontend()` method so you have your own output.

## Caching

To speed up your system you can enable the cache for each block, to enable the caching you have to define a [caching component](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-caching-data.html#cache-components) in your config. By default block caching is disabled for all blocks.

```php
class MyTestBlock extends \cmsadmin\base\Block
{
    public $cacheEnabled = true;
}
```

This will cache the block for 60 minutes but you can adjust the number of seconds the block should be cached by defining the cacheExpiration propertie:

```php
public $cacheExpiration = 60;
```

You can enable block caching for a block event if the caching component is not registered, so you can redistribute blocks and the behavior of them.

## Env option

Each block is placed in an Environemnt (Env) you can access those informations inside your block logic:

```php
$this->getEnvOption($key, $defaultValue);
```

the following keys are available:

+ *id* Return the unique identifier from the cms context
+ *blockId* Returns the id of this block (unique identifier)
+ *context* Returns frontend or backend to find out in which context you are.
+ *pageObject* Returns the `cmsadmin\models\NavItem` Object where you can run `getNav()` to retrievew the Nav Object.
+ *isFirst* Returns whether this block is the first in its placeholder or not.
+ *isLast* Return whether his block is the last in its placeholder or not.
+ *index* Returns the number of the index/poisition within this placheholder.
+ *itemsCount* Returns the number of items inside this placeholder.
+ *isPrevEqual* Returns whether the previous item is of the same origin (block type, like text block) as the current.
+ *isNextEqual* Returns whether the next item is of the same origin (block type, like text block) as the current.

#### Properties from CMS Page

If there are any CMS properties defined you can access them like this:

```php
$propObject = $this->getEnvOption('pageObject')->nav->getProperty('myCustomProperty');
```

If there is a property defined you will get the property object otherwhise returning `false`.

## Using assets in Blocks

Blocks can have [Assets (CSS&JS)](app-assets.md). To register an asset use `public $assets = []` and define all assets you want to auto register. Assets will only regsitered in frontend context and are **not available** in the administration area.

```php
class TestBlock extends \cmsadmin\base\Block
{
    public $assets = [
        'apps\assets\TestBlockAsset',
        'apps\assets\TestBlockZweitesAsset',
    ];
}
```

## Ajax Requests in Block

To implement ajax inside a block the following concept is used:

+ `createAjaxLink()`: Create the link to the callback, this url must be used for your ajax requests.
+ `callback...()`: Define a callbacked, you have to prefix the method with *callback*.

Create a callback and define all parameters. The callback is what the url returns to your javascript, can be html or json.

```php
public function callbackHelloWorld($time)
{
    return 'hallo world ' . $time;
}
```

The above callback requires the parameter `$time` and must be called trough an ajax call inside of the javascript, to create the url for this specific callback we are going to use createAjaxLink:

```php
$this->createAjaxLink('HellWorld', ['zeit' => time()]);
```

You could store this created link from above inside your extras vars and pass it to the javascript.

#### Callback parameters

You can pass aditional values to the callback by using the post ajax method and collect them in your callback via Yii::$app->request->post(). The get parameters are used to resolve the callback.


# Block Groups

We have added the ability to manage the block groups via classes, so you can add new groups on your blocks can depend on a block group, when you run the import command luya will create the folders (block groups) and add/update the blocks into the provided groups.

To add new blockgroups create folder in your `@app` namespace, or inside a module with the name `blockgroups`, to add a folder create class like this `app\blockgroups\MySuperGroup`:

```php
<?php
namespace app\blockgroups;

class MySuperGroup extends \cmsadmin\base\BlockGroup
{
    public function identifier()
    {
        return 'my-super-group';
    }
    
    public function label()
    {
        return 'My Super Group Elements';
    }
    
    public function getPosition()
    {
        return 30;
    }
}
```

> The position of the block will start from lower to higher, means 1 will be at the top of the groups list in the administration and even higher will be more at the bottom.

the folder will be created on import. Now blocks can belong to this folder, to do so override the `getBlockGroup` method of your block:

```php
public function getBlockGroup()
{
    return \app\blockgroups\MySuperGroup::className();
}
```

You can also use one of the predefined group block class:

+ `\cmsadmin\blockgroups\MainGroup::className()` (this is default group for all blocks)
+ `\cmsadmin\blockgroups\LayoutGroup::className()`
+ `\cmsadmin\blockgroups\ProjectGroup::className()`
+ `\cmsadmin\blockgroups\DevelopmentGroup::className()`
