/**
 * Filter to enable Response Cache.
 *
 * This filter can be applied on actions of a controller and is mainly used to cache API Response Data. The ability
 * to set duration an dependency are limited to a singel filter ability. So in order to use different dependencies
 * for different actions you have to the response cache as multiple behaviors.
 *
 * Cache different actions for a duration of 60 minutes:
 *
 * ```php
 * public function behaviors()
 * {
 *     return [
 *         'responseCache' => [
 *             'class' => ResponseCache::className(),
 *             'actions' => [
 *                 'action1', 'action2', 'the-other-action',
 *             ],
 *             'duration' => (60*60)
 *         ]
 *     ];
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Cache action with dependency and differnt variations for an action with an `id` param. This allows you to ability
 * to cache only the response for the specific parameter.
 *
 * ```php
 * public function behvaiors()
 * {
 *     return [
 *         'responseCache' => [
 *              'class' => ResponseCache::className(),
 *              'actions' => [
 *                  'get-data',
 *              ],
 *              'variations' => [
 *                  Yii::$app->request->get('id'),
 *              ],
 *              'dependency' => [
 *                  'class' => 'yii\caching\DbDependency',
 *                  'sql' => 'SELECT * FROM data WHERE id=:id',
 *                  'params' => [':id' => Yii::$app->request->get('id', 0)],
 *              ],
 *         ],
 *     ];
 * }
 * ```
